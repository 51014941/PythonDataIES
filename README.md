# Data Processing in Python Course (IES)
The course site for the Data Processing in Python from [IES](http://ies.fsv.cuni.cz/).

# Course description
The aim of the course is to provide the students with hands-on experience with the data-manipulation techniques in Python, with special emphasis on standard libraries such as *Pandas*, *Numpy* or *Matplotlib* and also gathering of data with *requests* and *BeatifiulSoup*. The students will also be guided through the modern social-coding and open-source technologies such as *GitHub*, *Jupyter* and *Open Data*.

The students will gain their experience using the data from the IES website and Evaluation protocols.

## Learning outcomes
After passing the course, the students will be able to download the data from APIs or directly from the web, pre-process it, analyze it and visualize it.

## Prerequisities
The course can either only for master students or Econometrics I. can be set as an explicit prerequisity to allow for 3rd year bachelor students

The course is designed for students that have already experienced at least some basic coding experience. It does not need to be very advanced, but they know what is ` for ` loop and how to use `if` and `else`.

## Credits
Passing the course will be rewarded with 6 ECTS credits

# Course requirements
The requirement for passing the course is submission of the homework and the final project.

## Homework
Through the homework the students will gather the basic programming skills allowing them to choose appropriate final project topic.

## Final project
Students choose their own topic and the data source, that  would be approved by the TAs. It should not be the data from the seminars.

The final project should fulfill the following criteria:
1. Should be submitted as a GitHub repository. Only the github link is submitted to the course TAs.
2. The main results should be summarized in the Jupyter notebook in the root of the repository. 
3. The project should use the raw data scraped either from the public API or directly from the web.
4. The data should be pre-processed to analysis ready format.
5. The project should contain appropriate analysis and visualization.
6. The project should contain the commented ready-to-run data download method.
