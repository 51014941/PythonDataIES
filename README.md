# Data Processing in Python (JEM207)
The course site for the Data Processing in Python from [IES](http://ies.fsv.cuni.cz/). See information on SIS.

# Course description
The aim of the course is to provide a hands-on experience with the data-manipulation techniques in Python. The special emphasis is put on standard libraries such as *Pandas*, *Numpy* or *Matplotlib* and also collecting web data with *requests* and *BeatifiulSoup*. The students will also be guided through the modern social-coding and open-source technologies such as *GitHub*, *Jupyter* and *Open Data*.

The students will gain their experience using the data from the IES website and subject evaluation protocols.

## Learning outcomes
After passing the course, the students will be able to download the data from APIs or directly from the web, pre-process it, analyze it and visualize it.

## Prerequisities
Econometrics II. (JEB110) is an explicit prerequisite for bachelor students.

The course is designed for students that have at least some basic coding experience. It does not need to be very advanced, but they should be aware of concepts such as ` for ` loop ,`if` and `else`,`variable` or `function`.

No knowledge of Python is required for entering the course.

## Credits
Passing the course is rewarded with 5 ECTS credits.

# Course requirements
The requirement for passing the course is submission of the homework and the final project.

## DataCamp Assignments (20%)
**Assignment 1** - Submission on 28/2 (Introduction to Python Course)

 1. Python Lists
 2. Function and Packages

**Assignment 2** - Submission on 28/2 (Web Scraping in Python Course)

 1. Introduction to HTML
 2. XPaths and Selectors
 3. CSS Locators, Chaining, and Responses


## Final project (80%)
Students choose their own topic and the data source, that would be approved by the TAs. It should not be the data from the seminars.

The final project should fulfill the following criteria:
1. Should be submitted as a GitHub repository. Only the github link is submitted to the course TAs.
2. The main results should be summarized in the Jupyter notebook in the root of the repository. 
3. The project should use the raw data scraped either from the public API or directly from the web.
4. The data should be pre-processed to analysis ready format.
5. The project should contain appropriate analysis and visualization.
6. The project should contain the commented ready-to-run data download method.
