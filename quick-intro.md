# Quick set-up of Jupyter and Github

0) Install latest [Anaconda]() and [GitHub]() on your computer

1) On the main page of this repository click Clone or Download and copy the repository's public link
2) Launch the command shell
3) using `cd` find the directory that you want to save your repository into. I.e. if you want your repository saved directly in the `Documents` folder go into `Documents` folder.
4) Type `git clone [link]` (without brackets).
Hurray, you downloaded your very first GitHub repo
5) Go to your git directory, i.e. type `cd [projectName]`
6) Type `jupyter notebook` in your command shell.
Your Jupyter should be running on [localhost:8888](http:\\localhost:8888)
